# Investigating The Movie Database (TMDb) Dataset
In this project, I've analyzed a data set containing information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb).

## Project Overview
In this project, we have to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it.
We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

What do I need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

It will be recommend to installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.

### Why this Project?
In this project, we have to go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.
I have also use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! 
## Notice
This notebook contains an interactive plot with animation.
